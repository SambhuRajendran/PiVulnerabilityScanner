# Vulnerability Scanning on Raspberry Pi

## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to set up and use Nessus, a comprehensive vulnerability scanning tool, on Windows to scan Raspberry Pi devices for security vulnerabilities. This guide will walk you through installing Nessus on Windows, setting up your scans, and interpreting the results.

## Installation

### Installing Nessus on Windows
1. Download Nessus for Windows from the official documentation: [Install Nessus on Windows](https://docs.tenable.com/nessus/Content/InstallNessusWindows.htm).
2. The installation process involves downloading a `.msi` file from the website and running it on your system.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

### Configuring Nessus
1. Upon installation, launch Nessus and select the 'Essentials' version for basic scanning capabilities.
